# Game design

## What this is

A tower defense game that teaches system architecture through gameplay. User traffic is the enemy, infrastructure components are the towers, and a live economy (revenue per request, operational costs, budget constraints) makes architecture decisions feel like business decisions.

The game must stand on its own as a strategy game first. The learning is the long-term payoff; the fun is what gets players there. Position as a strategy game, let the architecture depth be the surprise.

**KSP analogy:** KSP doesn't teach aerospace engineering, but after playing it every orbital mechanics concept has an experiential anchor. We do the same for system architecture. A player who finishes this game and later encounters caching, load balancing, or sharding in a tutorial already has the intuition.

## Two modes, one engine

- **TD Mode** (ships first): Game-first. Components expose limited capabilities through placement, connection, and upgrades. Waves test the player's architecture under pressure. Build → watch → assess → repeat. No mid-wave intervention.
- **Sandbox Mode** (designed-for from day one, built later): Full capability set unlocked. Player configures traffic, triggers chaos, explores tradeoffs without economic pressure.

Both modes share the same component system. A Database in TD has `StorageCapability(tier=1)` and flavor text; in Sandbox it exposes `SchemaCapability`, `ReplicationCapability`, and `QueryCapability`. The ModeController determines the aperture; components never know which mode they're in.

## Core design principles (one-liners)

- **Fun first** — learning is byproduct; anything that feels pedagogical gets cut.
- **Real terminology from day one** — "cache" not "memory cache." Montessori principle: the real word connects to every tutorial and job posting outside the game.
- **Tradeoffs, not right answers** — multi-axis scoring (cost, performance, reliability). The best architecture is the cheapest one that still performs under worst-case load.
- **Build → Watch → Assess** — no mid-wave intervention. Maps to how real engineering works (deploy, observe, diagnose, iterate). Auto-battler loop.
- **Wrong intuitions on purpose** — caches don't always help, load balancers don't always matter, queues trade latency for throughput. Open-ended levels with valid-tradeoff Pareto frontiers.

## Design docs (read on demand)

- **`component-architecture.md`** — object model, 7 core abstractions, 4-phase execution pipeline (INTERCEPT/PROCESS/REPLICATE/OBSERVE), engine sub-interfaces (EngineConsultable/EngineBufferable), 10-step simulation tick, 13-component registry with key capabilities, extensibility contract, zones/multi-region, auto-scaling. Authoritative for engine design target.
- **`wave-progression-strategy.md`** — two scaling axes (intensity + diversity), 7 request types, 10-wave progression with architectural lessons, boss waves, economic pressure curve.
- **`brainlift-system-architecture-game.md`** — purpose, SPOVs, research insights, market analysis, design theory.
